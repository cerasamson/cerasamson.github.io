An advocate for inclusivity in tech, I'm currently seeking opportunities in Product Management.":"My interest in the field grew from transforming thoughts into\ndigital realities. I spent my childhood building my own games\nin Minecraft and Roblox, brainstorming everything from storylines to monetization.\nThese early endeavors taught me how to bring a product into\nfruition, igniting my passion for computers and design.Inspired by these experiences, I pursued a major in computer science and leveraged\nsoftware engineering internships to create tools for developers\nand students.\nI now aspire to combine my technical background with my passion for creating to\nhelp build products that make a difference in people's lives.","lets-connect#Let's connect:":"GitHub: @cerasamsonLinkedIn: @cerasamsonEmail: cerasamson@gmail.com"}}}
