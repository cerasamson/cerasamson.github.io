# Cera Samson

## Hi, I'm Cera!
### I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. An advocate for inclusivity in tech, I'm currently seeking opportunities in Product Management.

My interest in the field grew from transforming thoughts into
digital realities. I spent my childhood building my own games 
in Minecraft and Roblox, brainstorming everything from storylines to monetization.
These early endeavors taught me how to bring a product into
fruition, igniting my passion for computers and design.

Inspired by these experiences, I pursued a major in computer science and leveraged
software engineering internships to create tools for [developers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-preview-6/#empty-blazor-project-templates)
and [students](https://github.com/dotnet-interactive-learning/journey#the-project-has-moved-into-the-main-net-interactive-repository-permanently-this-is-no-longer-tracked-or-used-please-contribute-and-report-issues-or-feature-requests-on-the-net-interactive-repository-repository).
I now aspire to combine my technical background with my passion for creating to
help build products that make a difference in people's lives.
